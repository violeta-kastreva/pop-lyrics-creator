# Neural Network Lyric Generation Experiment

Welcome to my experimental project where I've been playing around with neural networks to dive deeper into the fascinating world of machine learning and artificial intelligence. This endeavor is purely experimental, aimed at exploring the capabilities of neural networks in generating text, specifically focusing on song lyrics.

## Overview

The core of this project is an exploration into text generation using the GPT-2 model, a powerful neural network designed by OpenAI for natural language processing tasks. The experiment involves fine-tuning GPT-2 on various datasets, including an intriguing attempt to capture the lyrical style of Taylor Swift, and playing with different "temperatures" to adjust the creativity of the generated text.

## Objectives

- **Learn and Understand**: This project serves as a sandbox for me to learn new concepts related to neural networks, natural language processing, and text generation.
- **Experiment**: By tweaking different parameters and observing the outcomes, I aim to get a hands-on understanding of how neural network models behave and how subtle changes can affect the generated output.
- **Creative Exploration**: Beyond the technical learning, this project is an avenue for creative exploration, seeing how AI can be used as a tool for generating art, in this case, song lyrics.

## Key Features

- **GPT-2 Fine-Tuning**: Utilizing the pre-trained GPT-2 model and adjusting it to generate text based on specific datasets.
- **Temperature Adjustments**: Experimenting with different temperatures to influence the randomness and creativity of the text generation.
- **Focus on Lyrics**: Although the project is broad in its exploration of text generation, a significant focus is placed on generating song lyrics, aiming to mimic the style of iconic songwriters.

## Reflections

This project is an ongoing learning journey. It's been fascinating to see how a neural network can be guided to generate content that resembles human creativity. While the results have been mixed, with outputs ranging from surprisingly coherent lyrics to amusingly nonsensical text, each outcome has been a valuable lesson in itself.

## Conclusion

As I continue to play around with neural networks and learn new things, I look forward to diving deeper into the world of AI and exploring its potential in creative domains. This project is just the beginning, and I'm excited about where this exploration will lead.

Thank you for checking out my experimental project!
